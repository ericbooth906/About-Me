    <h2>Introducing Variable Fonts</h2>
    <div>
    
        <p><b>New font technology</b> - OpenType Font Variations – informally referred to as “variable fonts” was released in 2016 as a joint initiative of Adobe, Apple, Google and Microsoft, and has had a huge impact on web development and presentation.  There is a difference between font and typeface: a typeface is the underlying visual design that can exist in many different typesetting technologies; a font is one of these implementations, in a digital file format. In other words, a typeface is what you see, and the font is what you use.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Smaller file size </li> 
            <li>Only one file</li> 
            <li>Flexible design range</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>This change is a boon to creators who previously were forced to balance design expressiveness (the number of fonts used) with website performance (the amount of data to download). Downloading a single file instead of multiple individual fonts can yield a significant performance gain in reduced file size and fewer file requests.
        </p>
        <p>The variation axis expresses a single aspect of a typeface design. There are two types of axes - registered and custom - and five registered axes, which control known, predictable features of the font:  
        </p>
        <strong>Weight (wght)</strong>
            <br>( CSS attribute: font-weight)
            <br>The weight axis defines how light or bold a font looks and can range from lighter/thinner weight to super heavy extremes. Variable fonts allow designers to choose values (expressed as minimum and maximum numeric values) in order to highlight various elements.
        <br> 
        <strong>Width (wdth) </strong>
            <br>( CSS attribute: font-stretch)
            <br>In typeface design, width design is expressed using terms such as condensed, compressed, or extended to identify narrow or wide a font is relative to the “normal” design.
        <br>    
        <strong>Italic (ital) </strong>
            <br>( CSS attribute: font-style)
            <br>The italic axis usually means slanted strokes. Having italics available alongside the upright forms is useful when combined with weight to handle everyday needs for body copy, requiring only 1 or 2 files instead of at least 4.
        <br>    
        <strong> Slant (slnt) </strong>	
            <br>( CSS attribute: font-style)
            <br>Slant is similar but slightly different than italic. Slant is expressed as a degree continuum such as “greater than -90 and less than +90” and, also does not contain the glyph substitution that is present inn italic.
        <br>     
        <strong>Optical size (opsz)</strong>
            <br>( CSS attribute: font-optical-sizing)
            <br>A good optical-size axis makes type more legible at smaller sizes, a process that dates back to printing in the early 16<sup>th</sup> century, when punch cutters hand-carved type out of metal and would cut smaller type with slightly thicker strokes so that it would print well and be legible at smaller sizes
        <br>
            <p>In addition, to the above type designers can create infinite variations by customizing the axes for  grade, expressiveness, the ascender and descender height of lowercase letters, and other innovative modifications.  
            </p>
            <p> Modern web development has benefitted from the wisdom of the ages, especially the concept of optical sizing, which fell out of practice in the age of digital type and photo typesetting yet has come back in full force as visual presentation must be responsive to screen sizes that range from phone to desktop. OpenType Font Variations showcase the benefits that can occur when content creators and designers work effectively with the tech side of the house to address issues on both sides of the web development.
